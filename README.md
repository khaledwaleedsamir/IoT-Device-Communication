# IoT Device Communication System

## Overview

This project implements an IoT device communication system using C++ with YOCTO for Raspberry Pi and QEMU. The system transmits sensor data between multiple QEMU client devices and a central server running on Raspberry Pi. The communication occurs through TCP and UDP sockets, implemented in C++.
